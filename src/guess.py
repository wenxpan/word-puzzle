  Hello, {name}! Welcome to [bold]WORD PUZZLE[/bold].

  You have {num_chances} attempts to guess a secret word. After each guess, hints will be provided:
    - [bold black on bright_green] Green [/bold black on bright_green] \
means the letter is in the secret word and at the same place.
    - [bold black on bright_yellow] Yellow [/bold black on bright_yellow] \
means the letter is in the secret word but at the wrong place.
    - [bold black on white] Grey [/bold black on white] means the letter \
is not in the secret word.

You can customise the game by going to settings - upload a custom word list, set number of chances, and export all your records!

**Type '\\r' to restart and '\\q' to quit at any time of the game.**
